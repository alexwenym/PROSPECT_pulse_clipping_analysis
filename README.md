# PROSPECT_pulse_clipping_analysis

The relevant analysis code are located in jupyter notebooks. The latest iteration is located in `clipping_analysis5.ipynb`. It features the study with waveforms generated by averaging over raw data. 

The relevant template waveforms and raw data are located at `/home/awen/pulse_clipping` on the Wright server at Yale. It should be downloaded before running the notebooks. 

`helper.py` contains many helper functions that calculate arrival time, PSD, etc, and are called throughout the analysis notebooks.
